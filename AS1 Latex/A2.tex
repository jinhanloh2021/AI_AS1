        This table can be interpreted as three independent events $M_1$, $M_2$ and $C$. The manufacturer of the two test kits received by a person and their actual health are independent, but they will determine the result of the test kit.
  \item Write conditional probabilities (numerical values) associated with each node of this Bayes net. As there are 5 variables, please specify one conditional probability table (CPT) for each variable.

        For values of $n = \{1, 2\}$ as each person has two test kits.
  \item Are the results of the two tests dependent or independent given the evidence that the Covid Status is known? Justify your answer.\\[5pt]
        There is a common cause structure $R_1 \leftarrow C \rightarrow R_2$ which couples $R_1$ and $R_2$. But given the COVID status $C$, it decouples $R_1$ and $R_2$. Thus they are independent.
  \item Assume you took both tests at home. After being tested twice in a matter of minutes, the first test was positive and the second negative. What is the probability that you actually have COVID19? Show your analytical computations.\\[5pt]
        Given that the first test was positive and the second test was negative, then
        \begin{align*}
          R_1 & =1 \\
          R_2 & =0
        \end{align*}
        We are trying to solve for $P(C=1\mid R_1=1, R_2=0)$. Since $R_1$ and $R_2$ are conditionally independent on $C$,
        \begin{align*}
          P(C=1\mid R_1=1, R_2=0) & =\frac{P(R_1=1, R_2=0\mid C=1)P(C=1)}{P(R_1=1, R_2=0)}          \\[5pt]
                                  & =\frac{P(R_1=1\mid C=1)P(R_2=0\mid C=1)P(C=1)}{P(R_1=1, R_2=0)}
        \end{align*}
        \begin{align*}
            & P(C=c, M_1=m_1, M_2=m_2, R_1=r_1, R_2=r_2)                                                      \\
          = & P(C=c)\cdot P(M_1=m_1) \cdot P(M_2=m_2) \cdot P(R_1=r_1\mid C, M_1) \cdot P(R_2=r_2\mid C, M_2)
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
